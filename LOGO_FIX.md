# âœ… Logo Fixes Applied

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. Logo Size Increased âœ…
**Before:**
- Desktop: 50px height (too small)
- Mobile: 40px height (too small)

**After:**
- Desktop: 70px height (better visibility)
- Mobile: 50px height (readable on mobile)

### 2. Logo Location âœ…
**Correct Usage:**
- Using: `/assets/Navbar-logo.png` (in `public/assets/`)
- This is correct for Vite projects

### 3. Unused Files to Delete Manually:
Please delete these unused files:
- `client/src/assets/` folder (entire folder unused)
- `client/public/assets/Navbar1-logo.png` (not referenced anywhere)

**Keep:**
- `client/public/assets/Navbar-logo.png` âœ… (in use)

---

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works:

In Vite projects:
- Files in `public/` are served at root `/`
- So `public/assets/logo.png` â†’ `/assets/logo.png`
- Files in `src/assets/` need import statements (not used here)

---

## âœ… Result:
Logo is now **40% bigger** and more visible! ðŸŽ‰
